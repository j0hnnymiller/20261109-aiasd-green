# React and TypeScript Instructions

## Overview

Apply these rules to the task-manager browser interface. The approved stack is React and TypeScript; exact versions, component libraries, build tooling, and test libraries remain unselected. Follow the [architecture specification](../../task-manager-architecture.md) and do not treat these instructions as authorization to implement the application.

## Component and Type Rules

- Keep components focused on a user workflow and separate reusable presentation from API and domain behavior.
- Enable and preserve strict TypeScript checking. Model API requests, responses, loading, saving, conflict, and error states explicitly; avoid `any` and unchecked casts.
- Treat server-confirmed data as authoritative. Keep unsaved drafts distinct from the last confirmed server state.
- Keep date-only task due dates as date-only values. Do not parse them as UTC timestamps or shift them through the browser's local time zone.
- Derive workspace scope and authorization on the server. Never trust a client-supplied workspace identifier as proof of access.

## API, Refresh, and Mutation Behavior

- Use the same-origin API where deployment supports it. Keep API calls behind a small typed boundary; do not couple components to raw transport details.
- Fetch current data when the app opens, when the user returns to it, and on an explicit refresh. Do not add polling, push updates, hidden offline queues, or automatic task-content persistence.
- Coalesce duplicate focus/visibility refresh triggers. Prevent older refresh or mutation responses from overwriting newer confirmed state.
- Coordinate first-use provisioning across tabs that share the browser credential cookie. Share a non-secret pending attempt and hold a browser-wide lock through server confirmation and cookie processing; recheck access inside the lock before creating a workspace. Use a mechanism supported by the target browsers, and never persist or broadcast the credential itself.
- Preserve drafts during refresh. On refresh failure, retain the previous view and show a clear stale/error state; never replace it with an empty list that implies success.
- On save failure, preserve user input and explain the failure. Show “Saved” only after server confirmation; represent ambiguous outcomes as ambiguous, not as definite failure or success.
- Handle validation, unauthenticated access, unavailable resources, version conflicts, rate limits, and service failures as distinct user-visible states. For an invalid browser credential, explain that the task space is inaccessible and that the MVP has no account, pairing, or recovery; do not silently create a new workspace.
- Make task deletion explicit and immediate after confirmation. Do not add undo, trash, or workspace deletion. Named-list deletion must leave its tasks intact and unassigned.

## Security and Accessibility

- Treat all browser data and input as untrusted. Render task content as text; do not inject user-controlled HTML.
- Do not put browser credentials or other secrets in JavaScript storage, URLs, logs, analytics, or screenshots. Let the server manage the secure HttpOnly cookie; the MVP has no pairing grants or recovery secrets.
- Use semantic HTML, associated form labels, keyboard-operable controls, visible focus, and accessible names. Announce loading, save outcomes, validation errors, conflicts, and stale-data warnings to assistive technology without stealing focus.
- Preserve useful form values and provide actionable validation feedback; do not rely on color alone to communicate status.

## Verification Checklist

- [ ] Type-check and run the repository's configured frontend checks once tooling is selected.
- [ ] Verify keyboard and screen-reader access for task, list, and browser-credential error flows.
- [ ] Verify two tabs cannot provision competing first-use workspaces or replace a confirmed credential when response delivery is delayed.
- [ ] Verify refresh failure preserves the previous view and unsaved drafts.
- [ ] Verify stale responses cannot overwrite newer edits and conflicts retain the user's draft.
- [ ] Verify no polling, hidden offline writes, sensitive browser persistence, or unauthorized workspace access is introduced.
- [ ] Verify date-only due-date behavior against the approved local-date rule, including browser time-zone changes.
- [ ] Verify excluded product capabilities are not exposed.

## Summary

Keep the React/TypeScript client accessible and typed, with server-confirmed state, explicit refresh and error behavior, preserved drafts, and no client-side authority over workspace access.
